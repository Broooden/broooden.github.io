Chapter 3, Strafing: 

Strafing is the most simple and shortest part of this article. Strafing is something that exists in most games, strafing is where you move side to side to avoid getting hit by your opponents. However, unlike most games for minecraft certain strafes can be more effective than others. For example, if you strafe to the right the entire fight than you might as well just not strafe because your opponent can predict where you might go next. The way you should strafe is by mixing up how you strafe so you can try strafing to the left for 2 hits and then strafing to the right for 3 hits. Ultimately how you strafe will just be up to you. However, the way that I found to be the most effective for strafing is by strafing side to side each time you hit your opponent this is known as side to side strafing. Strafing as simple as it may be can be lethal if used in combination with a speed potion. As a bonus if you know if your opponent uses a really low sensitivity you can strafe to one side as it will be harder to aim at you with a lower sensitivity. If you know they have a really high sensitivity make sure to strafe from side to side well as it well mess them up.
