Chapter 4, Hit Selection and Ping:

Hit Selection and ping go hand and hand as depending on you and your opponents ping will depict if you should hit select or not hit select. First, what actually is hit selection? Hit selecting is when you let your opponent hit you first and you hit them right after to start a combo. The first thing that you should know is how it actually works. The idea of hit selection is to hit the ground before your opponent allowing you to build up momentum and ultimately start a combo. This may sound a little bit complicated but in reality it is just hitting your opponents right after they hit you. This is the same concept as the sprint resetting part here is the image to remind you:

Earlier I said that ping will depict if you should hit select or not. You should hit select if you or your opponents ping is 70 ms or higher, the reason why you should not hit select if you are both lower ping is because the knockback will register faster meaning that it will be much harder to hit your opponents back which would lead to you getting comboed instead of your opponent. The same thing would also happen if you were to incorrectly time the hit selection to be too late. Another thing is that if someone tries to use Hit Selection against you, you can quickly press S after you hit them so that you are too far for them to hit you and then you can combo them. Another counter is by doing side to side strafes to mess with the hit selectors aim which would lead to the hit selector to get comboed. Hit Selection is a strategy that is very high risk and high reward, if you succeed you will be able to combo your opponent and it is high risk because if you mess up you will be comboed. However, with enough practice you should be able to consistently pull off hit selection.
